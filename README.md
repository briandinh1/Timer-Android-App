# Timer-Android-App
A countdown timer app for Android. I tried copying features that the timer on my phone (Samsung S7) had. 

No number wheel for input, but I have an edit text and a set button. Simple :)

Can only set intervals of 1 minute. Caps out at 100 hours. 


Timer still "ticks" through orientation changes and exiting / force close to home screen. 
It saves the state of when it was last destroyed, so after re-opening you will still see the previous countdown time (0 if its expired) and it resumes as if nothing happened
